                          <p>The Warsaw University of Technology (WUT), founded in 1826, is a research and academic institution providing undergraduate, graduate and post graduate programs almost exclusively in engineering and applied sciences. With over 30 000 students and over 2 500 academics , WUT is the largest and top-ranked engineering university in Poland. Students can choose from a wide variety of degree courses, ranging from architecture to business and management, from mathematics and computer science to biotechnology, robotics, mechanics and environmental engineering, from applied chemistry to geodesy, transport and aeronautics - all together, there are 20 faculties/educational units. The academics and the students pursue the same goal: to meet the challenges of the changing world. Due to huge investments and restructuring efforts in the last decade, WUT can offer today not only a rich spectrum of paths to engineering careers, but also - for the most talented young people - individual paths of accelerated development and enables the graduates to reach the most prominent positions in science, technology and management.</p>

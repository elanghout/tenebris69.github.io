                    <p><b>The Conference</b> will take place at the new <b>Centre for Innovation and Technology Transfer Management of Warsaw University of Technology</b>, Rektorska 4.</p>
                          <p>The Warsaw University of Technology (WUT), founded in 1826, is a research and academic institution providing undergraduate, graduate and post graduate programs almost exclusively in engineering and applied sciences. With over 30 000 students and over 2 500 academics , WUT is the largest and top-ranked engineering university in Poland. Students can choose from a wide variety of degree courses, ranging from architecture to business and management, from mathematics and computer science to biotechnology, robotics, mechanics and environmental engineering, from applied chemistry to geodesy, transport and aeronautics - all together, there are 20 faculties/educational units. The academics and the students pursue the same goal: to meet the challenges of the changing world. Due to huge investments and restructuring efforts in the last decade, WUT can offer today not only a rich spectrum of paths to engineering careers, but also - for the most talented young people - individual paths of accelerated development and enables the graduates to reach the most prominent positions in science, technology and management.</p>

<p><b>The Gala Dinner</b> will take place on Tuesday 27 November at <b>Bazyliszek Restaurant</b> - one of those old, iconic places on the map of Warsaw. It is located in Rynek Starego Miasta 1/3 and has been running there for more than 25 years. The name of the restaurant comes from the famous Polish legend of the king of the serpents called Bazyliszek.
